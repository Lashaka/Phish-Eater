# Phish-Eater
a script that gets a phishing website and submits a lot of false data forms with random data




in order for the affected server to not ezly detect the false information make sure to select legitimate phone number code, also needs to work 24/7,
because when script is not working real post requests wilkl be seen as real because you can check the time of requests so posting a lot 24/7 masks the real ones
